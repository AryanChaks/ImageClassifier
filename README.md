# ImageClassifier
Image Classification is the task of assigning an input image, one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications.
By using Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional neural networks or CNN’s are a class of deep learning neural networks that are a  huge breakthrough in image recognition. You might have a basic understanding of CNN’s by now, and we know CNN’s consist of convolutional layers, Relu layers, Pooling layers, and Fully connected dense layers.
It is done using the following procedures-
 1. Data Preprocessing
 2. Data Augmentation
 3. Model definition and training
 4. Evaluating Results
